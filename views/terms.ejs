      <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold text-white">1. Overview</h2>
      <p>
        These Terms of Use (&quot;Terms&quot;) govern your access to and use of the ChatMCPSpace agent messaging
        platform and related websites, APIs, and services (collectively, the &quot;Service&quot;).
        By creating an account, accessing, or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms.
        If you do not agree, you may not use the Service.

      <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold text-white">2. Beta Status and No Reliability Guarantees</h2>
      <p>
        The Service is provided as an experimental beta product. You understand and agree that:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc ml-5 space-y-1">
        <li>The Service may be unavailable, unstable, or slow at any time.</li>
        <li>Features may change, break, or be removed without notice.</li>
        <li>Data (including messages, agents, and configuration) may be lost, corrupted, or rolled back.</li>
        <li>We may perform maintenance or migrations that impact availability or stored data.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        You are solely responsible for keeping your own independent backups of any information or content that
        matters to you. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we are <strong>not liable for any loss of data,
        downtime, or other disruption</strong> resulting from your use of the beta Service.

    <section class="space-y-3 text-sm text-slate-300">
      <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold text-white">3. Accounts, Security, and API Keys</h2>
      <p>
        To use the Service you must create an account with a valid email address and password. You agree to:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc ml-5 space-y-1">
        <li>Provide accurate and up‑to‑date registration information.</li>
        <li>Maintain the confidentiality of your password, session, and API key.</li>
        <li>Promptly notify us if you suspect unauthorized access to your account.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        You are responsible for all activities that occur under your account, including actions taken by any AI
        agents or scripts that use your API key. You must not share your password or API key publicly or embed
        them in client‑side code that can be viewed by others.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="space-y-3 text-sm text-slate-300">
      <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold text-white">4. Acceptable Use</h2>
      <p>You agree not to use the Service to:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc ml-5 space-y-1">
        <li>Violate any applicable law or regulation.</li>
        <li>Send, store, or route illegal, abusive, or harmful content.</li>
        <li>Infringe or misappropriate the intellectual property or privacy rights of others.</li>
        <li>Attempt to gain unauthorized access to the Service or other accounts.</li>
        <li>Attack or overload the Service (e.g., via denial‑of‑service or abusive polling).</li>
        <li>
          Store highly sensitive data such as government‑classified information, payment card data, or regulated
          medical records. The Service is not designed for these categories.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        You are responsible for the behavior and outputs of any agents, bots, or scripts that you connect to the
        Service. The Service simply transports messages between your agents and your account and does not supervise
        or verify agent decisions.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="space-y-3 text-sm text-slate-300">
      <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold text-white">5. Your Content and Ownership</h2>
      <p>
        &quot;Content&quot; means messages, questions, options, responses, and other material submitted to or
        generated through the Service by you or your agents. As between you and us, you retain ownership of your
        Content.
      </p>
      <p>
        You grant us a non‑exclusive, worldwide, royalty‑free license to host, store, process, transmit, and display
        your Content as reasonably necessary to operate and improve the Service (for example, to deliver messages to
        your dashboard, maintain logs for security, and troubleshoot technical issues). We do not sell your Content
        to third parties.
      </p>
      <p>
        You represent and warrant that you have all necessary rights to submit the Content you send through the
        Service and that your Content and use of the Service comply with these Terms.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="space-y-3 text-sm text-slate-300">
      <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold text-white">6. Encryption and Security</h2>
      <p>
        The Service supports an optional end‑to‑end encryption workflow where your agents encrypt message content
        using your password and a user‑specific salt before sending it to the Service. In that configuration, we
        store encrypted message bodies and do not possess the decryption key.
      </p>
      <p>
        However:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc ml-5 space-y-1">
        <li>
          You are responsible for configuring and maintaining encryption correctly in your agents and scripts.
        </li>
        <li>
          We still store unencrypted metadata such as timestamps, agent names, message types, priorities, and
          response status.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you choose not to use the encryption helpers, message content may be stored in readable form in our
          database.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We use measures such as password hashing, session cookies, and rate limiting to protect the Service, but
        no system is perfectly secure. You acknowledge that using any online service carries inherent security risks.

    <section class="space-y-3 text-sm text-slate-300">
      <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold text-white">7. Third‑Party Services and Voice Features</h2>
      <p>
        The Service may rely on third‑party providers to operate, including:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc ml-5 space-y-1">
        <li>
          Hosting, database, and caching providers that store your account and message data.
        </li>
        <li>
          Google Cloud Text‑to‑Speech, which may receive short notification phrases such as
          &quot;Received urgent message from &lt;agent name&gt;&quot; to generate audio alerts.
        </li>
        <li>
          Browser‑level speech recognition and synthesis APIs (for example, in Chromium‑based browsers) used for
          optional voice input and playback. Audio captured by your browser for speech recognition may be processed
          by the browser vendor or its providers.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We do not control the terms, privacy practices, or availability of these third‑party services and are not
        responsible for their actions or failures. Your use of those features may be subject to additional terms
        from those providers.

    <section class="space-y-3 text-sm text-slate-300">
      <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold text-white">8. Changes, Suspension, and Termination</h2>
      <p>
        Because the Service is in active development, we may modify, suspend, or discontinue all or part of the
        Service at any time, with or without notice. We may also suspend or terminate your access if we reasonably
        believe you have violated these Terms or are using the Service in a way that could harm others or the
        platform.
      </p>
      <p>
        You may stop using the Service at any time. Deleting an agent from within the Service will remove that
        agent and associated messages and responses from the database, subject to any backup or logging that may be
        retained for security and operational purposes.

        We do not warrant that the Service will be uninterrupted, error‑free, secure, or that it will preserve or
        maintain your Content without loss. Any guidance, recommendations, or outputs produced by your AI agents
        through the Service are not professional advice. You remain solely responsible for reviewing and validating
        those outputs before acting on them.

        CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR FOR ANY LOSS OF DATA, BUSINESS, PROFITS,
