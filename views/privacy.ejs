      <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold text-white">1. Data We Collect</h2>
      <p>When you use the Service, we may collect the following categories of information:</p>
      <h3 class="font-semibold text-white mt-2">Account Data</h3>
      <ul class="list-disc ml-5 space-y-1">
        <li>Email address you use to register and log in.</li>
        <li>
          Password, stored only as a bcrypt hash. We never store your plaintext password.
        </li>
        <li>
          A unique API key and an encryption salt generated for your account.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="font-semibold text-white mt-3">Agent and Message Data</h3>
      <ul class="list-disc ml-5 space-y-1">
        <li>Agent names associated with your account.</li>
        <li>
          Messages and questions sent by your agents, including content, priority, urgency flags, and optional
          free‑response hints.
        </li>
        <li>
          Options attached to interactive questions (option text, benefits, downsides, and default flags).
        </li>
        <li>
          Your responses to questions (selected options and optional free‑text explanations).
        </li>
        <li>
          Free‑text messages you send back to your agents from the dashboard.
        </li>
        <li>
          Timestamps and &quot;read&quot; status for messages and responses.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="font-semibold text-white mt-3">Usage and Log Data</h3>
      <ul class="list-disc ml-5 space-y-1">
        <li>
          HTTP request metadata such as IP address, request path, HTTP method, response status, and response size.
        </li>
        <li>
          Security‑related logs for authentication attempts, API key usage, rate‑limit events, and unauthorized
          access attempts (including IP address, user ID where available, and user agent).
        </li>
        <li>
          Error and performance logs used to debug and monitor the Service.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="font-semibold text-white mt-3">Voice and Audio Features</h3>
      <ul class="list-disc ml-5 space-y-1">
        <li>
          When server‑side text‑to‑speech is enabled, we may send short notification phrases (for example,
          &quot;Received urgent message from &lt;agent name&gt;&quot;) to Google Cloud Text‑to‑Speech to generate
          audio files that are cached on our server.
        </li>
        <li>
          Optional in‑browser speech recognition and speech synthesis use your browser&apos;s Web Speech APIs.
          Audio for speech recognition may be processed by the browser vendor or its providers; this is handled by
          your browser, not by our servers.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="font-semibold text-white mt-3">Cookies and Local Storage</h3>
      <ul class="list-disc ml-5 space-y-1">
        <li>
          Session cookies used to keep you signed in. These cookies are httpOnly and are required for basic
          functionality.
        </li>
        <li>
          Local storage and session storage entries in your browser, such as voice notification preferences and a
          derived encryption key used for end‑to‑end encryption. These values are stored client‑side; we do not read
          them on the server.

      <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold text-white">2. How We Use Your Data</h2>
      <p>We use the data described above to:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc ml-5 space-y-1">
        <li>Create and maintain your account and authentication sessions.</li>
        <li>Deliver agent messages, questions, and responses to your dashboard and APIs.</li>
        <li>
          Generate API guides, setup scripts, and integration helpers that embed your API key, base URL, and
          encryption salt.
        </li>
        <li>Provide optional text‑to‑speech and voice interaction features.</li>
        <li>Monitor and protect the Service through logging, rate limiting, and security auditing.</li>
        <li>Troubleshoot issues, analyze performance, and improve the Service over time.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We do <strong>not</strong> sell your personal information or your message content to advertisers or data
        brokers.

    </section>

    <section class="space-y-3 text-sm text-slate-300">
      <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold text-white">3. Encryption and Message Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        The Service supports an optional end‑to‑end encryption workflow. When enabled in your agents and scripts:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc ml-5 space-y-1">
        <li>
          Message content is encrypted on your side using your password and a user‑specific salt before being sent
          to the Service.
        </li>
        <li>
          Our servers store the encrypted ciphertext and the per‑user encryption salt but do not store your
          password or the derived encryption key.
        </li>
        <li>
          Decryption happens in your browser or agent runtime using your password or derived key.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Even when encryption is used, we still process unencrypted metadata such as timestamps, agent names,
        message type (message vs. question), priority, and whether a question has been answered. If you choose not
        to use the encryption helpers, message content may be stored in readable form in our database.

    <section class="space-y-3 text-sm text-slate-300">
      <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold text-white">4. Legal Bases and Use Restrictions</h2>
      <p>
        We process your information to provide and operate the Service, to secure and maintain the platform, and to
        comply with applicable law. You remain responsible for ensuring that your use of the Service (including any
        personal data you send through it) complies with the laws that apply to you.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Service is not intended for processing highly regulated categories of data such as payment card
        numbers, government‑classified information, or protected health information where specific legal regimes
        (for example, HIPAA) apply.

      <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold text-white">5. How We Share Information</h2>
      <p>We may share your information with:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc ml-5 space-y-1">
        <li>
          Infrastructure providers that host our application, databases, and caches in order to deliver the
          Service.
        </li>
        <li>
          Google Cloud or similar providers for server‑side text‑to‑speech, limited to short notification phrases.
        </li>
        <li>
          Service providers who help us monitor, secure, and operate the platform (for example, log aggregation or
          alerting tools).
        </li>
        <li>
          Law enforcement or other third parties when required by applicable law or to protect the rights,
          property, or safety of the Service, our users, or others.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We do not grant third parties the right to use your Content for their own advertising or independent data
        monetization.

    <section class="space-y-3 text-sm text-slate-300">
      <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold text-white">6. Data Storage, Retention, and Deletion</h2>
      <p>
        Data is stored primarily in our PostgreSQL database and, for some features, in Redis caches and on disk
        (for example, cached audio files for text‑to‑speech).
      </p>
      <p>In general:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc ml-5 space-y-1">
        <li>
          Account data is kept for as long as your account is active, unless we remove it under the Terms or as
          required by law.
        </li>
        <li>
          Messages, questions, options, and responses are kept while your account and relevant agents exist.
        </li>
        <li>
          Deleting an agent from within the Service will also delete associated messages, options, and user
          responses for that agent, subject to any backups or logs kept for security and operational purposes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Logs and backups may be retained for a period of time to support debugging, security investigations, and
          reliability, and may not be deleted immediately when you delete other data.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Because the Service is in beta, retention behavior may change as we refine the system. We aim to keep data
        no longer than reasonably necessary for the purposes described above.

        <li>
          You can clear local storage and session storage in your browser to remove locally cached encryption keys
