## Assessment Instructions

For evaluating agent to assess these results:

1. **Response Quality**: Check if each response accurately answers the weather query
2. **Response Completeness**: Verify responses include temperature, conditions, and relevant details
3. **Error Analysis**: For failed tests, determine if the error is:
   - Configuration issue (missing API key, CLI not installed)
   - Provider issue (service unavailable)
   - Command structure issue (incorrect flags or syntax)
4. **Performance**: Compare response times across providers
5. **Reliability**: Note any providers that consistently fail or timeout

### Key Questions to Answer:

- Which providers returned accurate weather information?
- Are there any command structure issues that need fixing?
- Which provider/model combinations are most reliable?
- Are there any patterns in failures (e.g., all sandbox modes fail)?
